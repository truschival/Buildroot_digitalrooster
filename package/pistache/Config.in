        help
          Pistache is a C++ REST framework written by Mathieu Stefani at
          Datacratic. It is written in pure C++11 with no external dependency and
          provides a low-level HTTP abstraction.  It provides both an HTTP client
          and server that can be used to create and query complex web and REST
          APIs.
